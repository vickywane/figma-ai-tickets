## Inspiration 

In my past roles as a Frontend Engineer, I've often seen project managers and other engineers (including myself) spend significant amount of time creating tickets within the epics for a sprint to implement a specific design or feature. I think Generative AI models are better suited for this task!

I wrote a Figma Plugin that extracts frames from Figma, and passes the frame to a GenAI model (GPT-4o) to generate a title, description, acceptance criteria and implementation scope for the ticket. If you're pleased with the generated data, the plugin also creates a ticket within a task management board (e.g Trello) in the board and column of your choosing.
